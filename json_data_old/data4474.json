Society is intricately entwined with advanced technology, where futuristic enhancements known as \"synthetics\" have become commonplace. These synthetic beings, indistinguishable from humans, have blurred the lines between man and machine, but have also stirred distrust among the population. Against this backdrop of high-tech decadence, a prominent cybernetics tycoon is found brutally murdered in his opulent penthouse. As the city teeters on the edge of chaos, Detective Max Nova, an aging cop who resists the allure of augmentations, is thrust into the heart of the investigation. With corruption lurking at every corner of this dystopian paradise, full of encrypted data streams, virtual-reality dens, and underground hacker collectives, Nova must navigate a labyrinthine web of deceit and danger to uncover the truth, all while his own past demons claw at his sanity. The future is grim, and in this techno-noir world, the boundaries between good and evil are as blurred as the line between reality and simulation.", "numberOfCharacters": 5, "evidence": {"_wittnessesComment": "whitnesses should be a list of a sebset of all the characters", "weapon": "knife", "witnesses": "null"}}, "characters": {"_comments": "fill this sections with several characters (this should match the numberOfCharacters value) that fit the story theme, only one person should be guilty", "judge": {"_comments": "the judge should never be guilty", "guilty": "false", "attributes": {"_comments": "all of theses should be float values between 0 and 1", "saddness": 0.5439810927333802, "happiness": 0.00785302777404906, "anger": 0.8786583216715422, "anxiety": 0.9995292326309516, "fear": 0.6183430625756087}, "background": {"firstName": "Detective", "lastName": "Steele", "age": "43", "occupation": "Private Investigator", "backstory": "A skilled ex-cybernetic law enforcement officer who lost their arm in a high-tech shootout.
